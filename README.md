# space-website

The Space Website is a project I created as part of ICT Web Application Development bootcamp, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This website showcases news, images and missions launching in 2025 and includes interactive features like user authentication and a fun space-themed quiz.

Features ✨  
Mission Launch Countdown: Displays the time left until the next space mission.  
User Authentication: A signup and login system using JavaScript and localStorage.  
Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes for a seamless experience.
